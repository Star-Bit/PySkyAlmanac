This is a specialized version of the PySkyAlmanac for Ankara Fen
Lisesi, 2012. It includes a LaTeX wrapper to present the chart along with
some usage notes.
To get the chart use (do not type "> ", just what comes after that):
> python skyalmanac_tr.py
This will produce almanac_2012_AFL.eps
Then run:
> latex AFL_gokyuzu.tex
> dvips -Ppdf AFL_gokyuzu.dvi
> ps2pdf AFL_gokyuzu.ps
which should produce a nice PDF file.
    
If you want to skip creating Postscript file and go directly to PDF,
you first need to modify skyalmanac_tr.py to produce PDF file
by changing the last line (it should be clear if you look in there),
then translate AFL logo into PDF with epstopdf script. Then you
should be good to go, I did not try this though.

have fun,
